#  Working with Pickle File in Python

This repository demonstrates how to save, load, and manage Python objects using the pickle module. Pickle is commonly used for object serialization, enabling data persistence and easy reuse of trained models, configurations, and complex data structures.

# What this project covers

Creating and saving Python objects using pickle
Loading (deserializing) objects from pickle files
Storing and retrieving:
Machine learning models
Lists, dictionaries, and custom objects
Understanding use cases and limitations of pickle

#Technologies Used
Python
Pickle module

# Use Cases
Saving trained ML/DL models
Persisting application state
Faster data loading compared to recomputation
